# Scripts
This is my collection of scripts that I have found useful over the years. 

Feel free to use these in your own environment. The scripts are sanitised and working at the time of uploading but it's always best practice to test scripts before running them in production. I take no responsibility for the outcome of these scripts.

Feedback is welcome!
